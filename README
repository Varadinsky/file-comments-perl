NAME
    File::Comments - Extracts comments from files in various formats

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Comments;

        my $snoop = File::Comments->new();

            # *----------------
            # | program.c:
            # | /* comment */
            # | main () {}
            # *----------------
        my @comments = $snoop->comments("program.c");
            # => " comment "

            # *----------------
            # | script.pl:
            # | # comment
            # | print "howdy!\n"; # another comment
            # *----------------
        my @comments = $snoop->comments("script.pl");
            # => (" comment", " another comment")

            # or just guess a file's type:
        my $type = $snoop->guess_type("program.c");    
            # => "c"

DESCRIPTION
    File::Comments guesses the type of a given file, determines the format
    used for comments, extracts all comments, and returns them in chunks.

    Currently supported are Perl scripts, C/C++ programs, Java, makefiles,
    JavaScript, Python and PHP.

    The plugin architecture used by File::Comments makes it easy to add new
    formats. To support a new format, a new plugin module has to be
    installed. No modifications to the File::Comments codebase are
    necessary, new plugins will be picked up automatically.

    File::Comments can also be used to simply guess a file's type. It it
    somewhat more flexible than File::MMagic and File::Type. File types in
    File::Comments are typically based on file name suffixes (*.c, *.pl,
    etc.). If no suffix is available, or a given suffix is ambiguous (e.g.
    if several plugins have registered a handler for the same suffix), then
    the file's content is used to narrow down the possibilities and arrive
    at a decision.

  FILE TYPES
    Currently, the following plugins are included in the File::Comments
    distribution:

        ###############################################
        # plugin                              type    #
        ###############################################
          File::Comments::Plugin::C          c 
          File::Comments::Plugin::Perl       perl
          File::Comments::Plugin::JavaScript js
          File::Comments::Plugin::Java       java
          File::Comments::Plugin::Makefile   makefile
          File::Comments::Plugin::HTML       html
          File::Comments::Plugin::Python     python
          File::Comments::Plugin::PHP        php

    The constants listed in the *type* column are the strings returned by
    the "guess_type()" method.
